## Components

### 1. Navbar (Navbar.js)

The Navbar component is responsible for rendering the navigation bar. It includes links to different sections of the website such as About, Services, Gallery, Booking, and Contact. The navigation bar is responsive, and the menu can be toggled on smaller screens.

### 2. Hero (Hero.js)

The Hero component represents the hero section of the webpage. It contains an image, a title ("EXPERIENTIAL TRAVEL BRANDS"), and a button. Clicking the button opens a modal with the message "Hello World."

### 3. Footer (Footer.js)

The Footer component renders a simple footer with a copyright notice.

### 4. App (App.js)

The App component is the main entry point of the application. It includes the Navbar, Hero, and Footer components to create the overall structure of the webpage.

## Styling (App.css)

The styling is organized in the App.css file, where global styles and specific styles for each component are defined. The CSS includes styling for the navbar, hero section, modal, and footer. Responsive design is implemented to adapt the layout for different screen sizes.
